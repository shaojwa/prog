#### before 可以做副词
表示副词的之前。

#### acquire vs require 
this deadlock requires each thread to acquire its lock at exactly the wrong time.
 
#### adhere
This situation can be avoided: if both threads adhere to a rule stating that A must always be acquired before B,

#### acquire
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

#### aptly
UNIX guru W. Richard Stevens aptly describes signals as software interrupts.

#### audit
SUDO gives an audit trail I believe under /var/log/secure.

#### argument
argument (ref: man shutdown)

#### authentication

#### authority

#### as if
If  a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a mutex,
upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for the mutex as if it was not interrupted.

#### below
The 'gdb' script provided below can be modified as fits.

#### care
Making a thread detached is useful for some types of daemon threads whose exit status the application does not need to care  about.

#### concurrent
 mutex is useful for protecting shared data structures from concurrent modifications

#### coin (=create)
The term trie was coined two years later by Edward Fredkin

#### code of practice
All members of the association adhere to a strict code of practice. 

#### collapse
collapse all

#### consult
consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior

#### contrast
in contrast to 0, which gets you to the beginning, regardless of whitespace or not.

#### crude

#### default
By default, on RedHat based distributions like CentOS and Fedora.

#### differ
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ.

#### additions
started by Ingo Molnar, additions by Arjan van de Ven

#### determine
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

#### detection
If the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL, deadlock detection shall not be provided.
 
#### demonstrate
The program below demonstrates the use of pthread_create(), as well as a number of other functions in the pthreads API.

#### dependent
Signal all dependent instructions that data is ready.

#### divert
if we divert the second write to an alternate storage location.

#### eliminate
Can we eliminate such dependencies?

#### equivalent
This is equivalent to calling pthread_exit(3) with the value

#### expand all

#### fairly
There was some fairly strong pushback against the mutex patch after last week's article was written.

#### heuristic

#### hang

#### infrastructure
basic facilities such as transport, communications, power supplies, and buildings

#### idempotent
In other words, signal delivery is idempotent.

#### indeterminate
it is indeterminate which thread—the caller or the new thread—will next execute.

#### incredibly 
it is simply incredibly broken.

#### IIRC
if I remember correctly

#### login
logged-in users (ref: man shutdown)   

#### mastery
#### meant
Note that these instructions are meant for developers who are compiling the code for development and testing.

#### multi-noun 
runtime locking correctness validator

#### maintain
If the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE, then the mutex shall maintain the concept of a lock count.

#### number
nproc - print the number of processing units available.
sched_getcpu() returns the number of the CPU on which the calling thread is currently executing.

#### order
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### obtain
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### permitted
Because a range of child nodes is permitted.

#### point
The discussion did not stop at that point。
Things may not come to this point often at all;

#### possible
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### preceding
The  process  attributes in the preceding list are all specified in POSIX.1-2001. 

#### production
it is not an option that one would enable on a production system.

#### redundant

#### refine
Ingo has continued to refine this patch set, with frequent releases;

#### result in
If  the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT, attempting to recursively lock the mutex results in undefined behavior. 

#### retrieval
Its real purpose is the launching and retrieval of small aeroplanes in flight.

#### relinquish

#### respect

#### redundant

#### restrict
Lists the active jobs.  JOBSPEC restricts output to that job.

#### specific
The parent and child also differ with respect to the following Linux-specific process attributes.

#### speculation
value speculation.

#### scheme
out-of-order general scheme.

#### trail
SUDO gives an audit trail I believe under /var/log/secure.

#### unless
Unless real-time scheduling  policies  are  being employed.

#### unified
made one, united

#### vertex

#### violate
The validator detects and reports lock usage that violate these single-lock state rules.

#### violation
This is in violation of the POSIX threads specification

#### without
Without options, the status of all active jobs is displayed.

#### wall
wall message: the mssage sent by command wall
